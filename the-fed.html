<section class="inline">1. The Federal Reserve Has Far Too Much Power to Control Our Economy</section><br>

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has the power to dramatically impact our economy at a drop of the hat. The central bank completely controls and determines the money supply. It is permitted to create as much money as it wants out of thin air with no restrictions. This is the antithetical to the principles that America was founded on. Our Founding Fathers would be outraged that one centralized institution has unchecked and unprecedented power to control the economy and thus our lives.<br>

<section class="inline">2. The Federal Reserve Has Significantly Devalued Our Currency</section><br>


The laws of supply and demand apply to money. The more dollars we have in the circulation, the less the currency is worth. Our money supply has rapidly increased over the past century due to the  Federal Reserve printing massive amounts of money like there is no tomorrow. This is what will almost inevitably happen when a quasi-governmental entity can simply print more money to its heartâ€™s content. Since the Federal Reserve came into existence in 1913, the dollar has lost over 95 percent of its value. Today's dollar is worth less than a nickel compared to the pre-1913 dollar.<br>

<section class="inline">3. The Federal Reserve Hurts the Poor and Middle Class the Most</section><br>


Our hard-earned money is essentially stolen through a hidden inflation tax. Inflation is the increase in the supply of money and credit. It is often wrongly defined as the general rise in the price of goods and services. But higher prices are actually a direct consequence of inflation since increasing the supply of money decreases the purchasing power of the dollar. Inflation hurts the poor most since they have less disposable income. Consumers with low disposable incomes will be negatively impacted by higher prices for food and clothing.
